# ... (You might need to add more specific executable names if they don't have .out extension)
# The script already filters for files without extensions in chapter directories,
# but gitignore is good for preventing untracked files showing up in status.

# Debugging symbols
*.dSYM/
# Or more specifically:
# 1-chapter/*/main.dSYM/
# 1-chapter/*/PrintStandard.dSYM/
# etc.

# VS Code settings
.vscode/
# You might want to keep some .vscode files if shared, but usually not.
# The current script ignores .vscode/ files during processing too.

# IntelliJ/CLion files
.idea/
# If you are using CLion, you might want to keep .idea/workspace.xml
# out of git and just track .idea/misc.xml for project settings.
# For this exercise, it's safer to ignore the whole thing.
